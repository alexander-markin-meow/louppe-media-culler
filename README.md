# Louppe

(˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)

**A fast, open-source photo and video culling app for Mac.**

Louppe helps review a folder or memory card, mark the shots you want to
keep, and export them.

Your photos stay in their original quality. Export copies them by default.
Louppe only moves originals when you deliberately choose **Move to…**, send
photos to the macOS Trash, or confirm **Organize Source Folder**. It never
permanently deletes a file.

macOS 14 or newer.

## Download

Download `Louppe.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/alexander-markin-meow/louppe/releases/latest),
unzip it, and drag `Louppe.app` into Applications.

Louppe is not notarized by Apple. The first time you open it, macOS may say it
cannot verify the developer. Right-click Louppe, choose **Open**, then choose
**Open** again. You only need to do this once.

## Basics

1. Open a folder or memory card.
2. Press **F** for Yes or **D** for No as you review.
3. Filter, sort, or select several photos when needed.
4. Press **⌘E** to copy your chosen photos to another folder.

Most photo and video formats are supported; support for more file types is
planned. Filters and sorting cover decisions, star ratings, color labels,
dates, folders, file types, camera details, media type, and video length.

Choose **File → Organize Source Folder…** to move All, Filtered, or Selected
items into nested folders such as Decision → Date. Check the folder levels you
want and drag them into priority order. Existing folder, date, stars, color,
camera, lens, file type, and media type can all be levels; date folder names
follow the Mac's language, region, and custom short-date format. The Command
Palette includes **Organize by Date Taken Only…** to open this screen with Full
date as the sole enabled folder level, ready for preview and confirmation.

Matching RAW+JPEG files are separate photos by default. In Filter → File types,
**Treat matching RAW + JPEG as one photo** groups an unambiguous match, including
across subfolders. RAW and JPEG always keep their own decision, stars, and color
label; while grouped, ratings, selection, Export, Move, and Clean Up apply to
both files.

For close inspection, Gallery offers a fast Fit view, a phone-sized preview
(**A**), and true 100% zoom (**S**). The Info panel includes metadata, a
histogram, and clipping information. Press **X** to mark clipped areas.

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Review and navigation

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| **F** | Mark Yes and move to the next undecided item |
| **D** | Mark No and move to the next undecided item |
| **0–5** | Clear stars or assign 1–5 stars without changing the Yes/No decision |
| **← / →** | Go to the previous / next item |
| **↑ / ↓** | Gallery: previous / next item. Grid: previous / next row |
| **Space** | Play or pause a video. On a photo, go to the next item |
| **S** | Gallery: switch between Fit and true 100% zoom |
| **A** | Gallery: switch between Fit and a phone-sized preview |
| **X** | Gallery: show or hide red clipping warnings on the photo |
| **Tab** or **G** | Switch between Gallery and Grid |
| **Q** | Show or hide the thumbnail browser in Gallery |
| **W** | Show or hide the info panel |
| **⌘+ / ⌘−** | Make Grid thumbnails bigger / smaller |

### Actions and selection

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| **E** or **⌘E** | Open Export |
| **R** | Clear all Yes/No decisions. Large sets ask for confirmation; **Return** confirms |
| **Z** or **⌘Z** | Undo the last decision, star, color-label, decision reset, Trash action, or source-folder organization |
| **⌘O** | Open a different folder |
| **⌘R** | Scan the current folder again |
| **⌘K** | Open the Command Palette to search actions, metadata tools, filters, and folder operations |
| **⌘A** | Select every item currently shown by the filter |
| **⌘⇧← / ⌘⇧→** | Select from the current item to the first / last |
| **Esc** | Cancel a scan or clear the current selection |
| **⌘⌫** | Move the selection to the Trash immediately, without a dialog. **⌘Z** restores it |

Letter review shortcuts such as F, D, and G stay active after clicking Decision,
View, toolbar, or video controls. When a control has keyboard focus, Space,
Tab, Escape, and the arrow keys remain available to that control. Louppe also
leaves every shortcut alone while you are editing or selecting text, or
responding to a dialog, sheet, or popover.

## Mouse and trackpad

- In Grid, click a photo to select it immediately. Click its status circle to
  change its Yes/No decision. Double-click the photo to open it in Gallery. These
  actions keep the Grid at the same scroll position.
- **Shift-click** selects a range. **Command-click** adds or removes one item.
- Drag across Grid photos to select several of them.
- In Gallery, double-click a point on a photo to inspect that area at true
  100% size. Double-click again to return to Fit.

Louppe also supports VoiceOver. Decisions, stars, labels, and controls do not rely on color
alone, so the main review workflow can be completed with the keyboard.

## Keeping your files safe

- Export combines decisions, stars, and colors, so only items matching all
  selected metadata are included. It uses **Copy** by default. **Move** is
  available when the destination is
  on the same storage volume and uses atomic filesystem renames; use Copy for
  another drive or card. **Metadata (XMP)** safely writes or merges sidecars
  beside the selected originals without copying, moving, or embedding media.
  Choose Universal XMP, Lightroom Classic, Bridge, Capture One, or darktable
  so decisions use the intended portable representation; stars and colors
  always keep their native XMP fields.
- Copy and Move now offer **Include XMP sidecars**. It starts off when the
  selected photos have no recognized XMP and starts on when at least one does;
  a manual choice remains in force until the Export sheet closes. With it on,
  Louppe creates or safely merges the destination stem packet and carries
  extension-qualified application packets unchanged. Copy never edits the
  source packet. Move leaves XMP behind when the option is off; when it is on,
  a shared RAW+JPEG packet is copied if a same-stem member stays behind and is
  transferred only when the whole family moves. Lightroom Classic `.acr`
  heavy-edit companions are never included or modified; Export warns when an
  exact associated companion will remain in the source folder.
- Metadata (XMP) inspects every same-stem family before writing. It shows
  creates, updates, already-current packets, unsupported files, and conflicts,
  then publishes through three bounded background lanes. When exactly one RAW
  and one JPEG disagree, **Resolve RAW + JPEG Conflicts…** can explicitly use
  either file’s Louppe metadata for both in one undoable action, or leave them
  separate and skip the shared packet. Louppe always rebuilds the selection and
  complete plan after a resolution. Existing edit data and unrelated keywords
  survive; replacing or removing an external color label requires explicit
  confirmation. A stop, folder change, rescan, or Quit waits
  for an atomic sidecar boundary, and an externally changed packet is skipped
  instead of overwritten. Sidecars for JPEG, TIFF, DNG, HEIC, and PNG are
  best-effort because some applications expect metadata embedded in those
  formats; Louppe never modifies the original to work around that limitation.
- Export checks the destination before starting. A long copy can be stopped
  safely, and a RAW+JPEG pair never gets left half-copied. Louppe prevents
  automatic system sleep while files are moving (the display may still turn
  off). Keep a MacBook lid open until the transfer finishes. If lid-close
  sleep does happen, Copy waits for the exact same removable source to remount
  after wake and safely retries an untouched in-progress file once. Completed
  copies remain at the destination; a failed in-progress temporary is removed
  only after Louppe verifies that exact physical file belongs to the operation.
- **Clean Up** sends files to the macOS Trash, never to permanent deletion.
  It asks for confirmation unless you use **⌘⌫**. Immediately afterward,
  **⌘Z** can restore the whole batch during the open session while the files
  remain in the Trash. Emptying the Trash deletes them permanently.
- **Organize Source Folder** previews every destination before moving anything.
  All, Filtered, and Selected scopes show live counts. Checked folder levels
  are applied in draggable priority order, so Decision → Date and Date →
  Decision create different layouts. **Existing folder** preserves either the
  old top-level folder or its full relative path; turning it off flattens that
  structure into the chosen new levels. Old folders are not deleted, even when
  they become empty, and hidden, unrelated, unsupported, and `.acr` files
  remain where they are. Grouped RAW+JPEG files and recognized XMP sidecars
  follow together. Any filename, sidecar-family, or destination conflict blocks
  the complete move—Louppe never adds a suffix or overwrites. **⌘Z** restores
  the previous file locations during the same open session. ExFAT camera cards
  show an extra reduced-crash-protection warning because macOS cannot durably
  flush their folder entries like APFS. After confirmation, Louppe first tests
  a pair of disposable files to prove macOS refuses an occupied destination,
  preserves the same physical file during a move, and keeps the bytes intact;
  it moves no photo if that check fails. Keep the card connected and the Mac
  awake until the operation finishes.
- Matching RAW+JPEG files, if grouped, move or copy together.
- Louppe keeps a small safety record during file operations. If the app is
  interrupted, Louppe checks the exact files and never overwrites an existing
  file. A completed Trash action stays in Trash—it is never silently undone on
  the next launch. If an unusual file action still needs attention, reviewing,
  rating, opening folders, saving, and quitting remain available; only another
  Copy, Move, Organize, Clean Up, or Trash undo waits. Retry when the relevant
  drive is available, or choose **Keep Files As They Are** to set aside only Louppe's
  recovery record—without deleting its contents—and continue with the files
  exactly where they are.
- Ratings are saved automatically in `.louppe_session.json` inside the opened
  folder, with an identity-bound local backup when that folder is read-only or
  its card/drive is temporarily disconnected. A clean Quit does not rewrite an
  already saved session just because the photo volume is no longer connected.
  Ratings follow the
  verified physical file across a rename, remain saved while a file is
  temporarily missing, and current identity-bound ratings are never silently
  applied to a same-named replacement. Louppe also refuses to overwrite a session file changed by
  another app and will not confuse two cards or folders that later use the
  same path. An older filename-only session upgrades automatically when every
  saved filename is still present in its original folder. If old saved items
  are missing, you can explicitly forget only their ratings and open the rest
  of the folder without restoring intentionally deleted files.

Louppe recognises common camera RAW files, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, HEIC, WebP, AVIF,
and the photo and video formats supported by macOS. An unsupported file still
appears in the review, so it can be rated and exported.
