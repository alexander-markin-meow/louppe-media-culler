# Louppe Media Culler — guidance for AI assistants

Native macOS photo-culling app. Swift/SwiftUI, plain SwiftPM executable —
**no Xcode project**. Apple Command Line Tools 26.6 are selected and are
sufficient to build/package the app. The XCTest target requires full Xcode
26.6 because the Command Line Tools installation does not include XCTest.
Both toolchains currently expose Swift 6.3.3 and the macOS 26.5 SDK.

The owner is a photographer, not a programmer: do the technical work for him,
explain results in plain language, and always verify the app actually launches
after changes.

There is no separate support team. The sole contact is Alex Markin at
`a@alex-markin.com`; use “Contact Alex” rather than “Contact support” in the UI.

## Build & install

```sh
./build_app.sh                          # release build → dist/Louppe.app
cp -R dist/Louppe.app /Applications/    # install (remove old copy first)
xattr -cr /Applications/Louppe.app      # copy can attach Finder metadata
codesign --verify --deep --strict /Applications/Louppe.app
swift build --disable-keychain          # quick debug check; public dependencies need no login
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  swift test --disable-keychain         # XCTest is supplied by full Xcode
```

`build_app.sh` bundles the binary + icon + Info.plist in `/private/tmp`, strips
extended attributes, ad-hoc signs, verifies there, then copies the result to
`dist/`, where `Scripts/verify_release.sh` verifies the exact app and archive.
Staging outside the File Provider-managed workspace is required:
Finder metadata may otherwise reappear between signing and verification. Still
run `xattr -cr` after copying into `/Applications`.

`VERSION` is the source of truth for the About-panel marketing version and
build number. **Bump the version/build pair exactly once per GitHub release
cycle**: the first change after the latest published GitHub release bumps
`VERSION` and opens one new `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and every further change
folds into that same entry (update its bullets and date — do not bump again)
until that version ships as the next GitHub release. Check the latest release
(`gh release list`) before deciding whether a bump is due; local installs of
work-in-progress builds are not releases and never justify a bump.
`build_app.sh` deliberately refuses to package a pair missing from the
history. History headings use
`## <MARKETING_VERSION> (<BUILD_NUMBER>) — <DATE>`. Keep release tags in the
form `v<MARKETING_VERSION>`.

Always build against the current macOS SDK. Do not work around toolchain errors
with an older SDK: doing so compiles out current SwiftUI features such as macOS
26 liquid-glass toolbar styling.

## Testing a build

Run the focused logic tests first, then verify by launching with a folder:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  swift test --disable-keychain --filter HotkeyTests
./Tests/run_performance_checks.sh
```

The complete `HotkeyTests` run is mandatory before **every** local app install,
even when the change seems unrelated to keyboard handling. It exercises the
installed-monitor path with real AppKit window events, including detaching and
reattaching the session view; direct `handleKey` unit tests alone are not an
adequate regression check.

The last two checks use disposable files for a real Trash/restore round trip.
In a restricted agent sandbox, rerun the script with permission to access the
macOS Trash if those checks report that the paired photo could not move.

```sh
open /Applications/Louppe.app --args -openFolder /path/to/photos
```

**Never pass a bare path argument** (`--args /path`): macOS treats it as a
document-open request, and because the app declares no document types the
system suppresses the app's default window — the app runs headless and
appears broken. The `-openFolder` flag form avoids this entirely.

The app writes `.louppe_session.json` into the opened folder within a few
seconds; inspect it from the CLI to confirm scanning/pairing/rating logic
without seeing the screen. Screen capture is NOT available for verification
(no Screen Recording permission) — ask the user to look, or check the sidecar.

## Architecture

One `SessionStore` (a `@MainActor ObservableObject`) is the single source of
truth, created in `LouppeApp` and passed to every view.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Sources/Louppe/LouppeApp.swift` | `@main`, window scene, menu-bar commands |

See `Docs/PERFORMANCE.md` before changing concurrency, caching, filtering, or
Clean Up. It records ownership boundaries, cache budgets, and verification.

## Invariants — do not change

- **Bundle identifier** `com.alexandermarkin.louppe` and **sidecar filename**
  `.louppe_session.json`. (Renamed from the original "loupe" spellings on
  2026-07-12 with the owner's consent — old sessions and folder permissions
  were intentionally abandoned. Don't rename again without asking: it resets
  saved ratings and macOS folder permissions.)
- **Originals are never modified or deleted, and never move without an
  explicit, confirmed command.** Export's default mode only copies. Three
  sanctioned exceptions, all owner-requested: (1) Clean Up in `SessionStore`
  (2026-07-13) moves rejected files to the macOS Trash via
  `FileManager.trashItem` — never a permanent delete — behind a confirmation
  dialog, with ⌘Z restoring the whole batch; no *single-key* hotkey for it
  (⌘⌫ trashing the selection without a dialog is the one sanctioned
  shortcut — Finder parallel, ⌘Z restores). (2) The Export dialog's
  **Move to…** mode (2026-07-21) transfers the chosen ratings' files to a
  user-selected folder after an explicit mode choice and an in-dialog
  warning; moved photos leave the session, the move is not undoable, and the
  files stay intact at the destination. (3) **Organize Source Folder…**
  (2026-08-17) moves a confirmed All/Filtered/Selected scope inside the opened
  source folder according to its previewed metadata hierarchy; it retains old
  folders, never overwrites or renames a collision, and ⌘Z restores file
  locations during the open session. (4) **Rename Files…** and the Info-panel
  pencil (2026-09-04) rename original filename stems inside their current
  folders after an exact preview or explicit single-name submission. Extensions
  and contents never change; RAW+JPEG and recognized XMP names follow as one
  journaled family, collisions and `.acr` companions block the plan, and ⌘Z
  restores the prior names during the open session. No other code path may move originals;
  nothing ever hard-deletes.
- Copy, Move, Rename, Organize, Trash, and their supported undo paths must activate a
  `FileOperationJournal` before their first filesystem change. Recovery must
  verify stable file identity, never overwrite an existing path, never infer
  ownership from a filename alone, and keep unresolved journals retryable until
  the photographer explicitly chooses **Keep Files As They Are**. That escape
  may retire only a canonical Louppe journal by atomically setting it aside as
  `.forgotten`; it must never delete the record's contents, adopt an arbitrary
  `.operation` file, or touch media.
  Launch recovery for an intentional Trash action commits forward: it must
  never restore a photo the photographer deliberately sent to Trash. Only the
  explicit in-session Undo restores it. macOS owns Trash durability and may
  deny direct access to `.Trash`/`.Trashes`, so never make opening or syncing a
  protected Trash directory a requirement for operation success.
  A fully completed Export Move stays at its destination during recovery; only
  an incomplete RAW+JPEG item rolls back. A partially checkpointed paired Trash
  action remains nonblocking attention instead of silently discarding its
  evidence. Trash Undo must never move a successfully restored member back into
  protected Trash merely to make a pair look atomic—keep the restored original,
  rescan, and report the partial undo.
  New plan-v3 paths use exact raw filesystem bytes; never normalize them
  through Swift strings. Export validation and target construction must carry
  the exact selected destination bytes into the worker. Keep v1/v2 recovery
  compatibility. Copy's staged checkpoint means the duplicate was fully
  written, flushed, and source-verified: recovery must preserve staged and
  completed copies without requiring the source volume to remain mounted, and
  may publish an identity-verified staged temporary only with an exclusive
  rename to its exact planned destination. macOS can change a new copy's ctime
  when it attaches provenance metadata, so operation-created copy identity
  checks use volume/inode/birth/size/mtime but not ctime; exact source checks
  still include ctime. A thrown `copyItem` may leave a partial: checkpoint its
  exact identity before removing it, and never delete an unrecorded partial by
  pathname. A complete pre-staged temporary may be published only after the
  exact planned source is revalidated and every byte compares equal.
- The hotkey map lives in `SessionView.handleKey` and is documented in
  README's shortcut table — keep the two in sync when changing keys.
- `SessionView`'s local monitor is the sole owner of session Command shortcuts;
  do not add duplicate menu `.keyboardShortcut` equivalents that bypass its
  window/focus gates. Review letters remain active after ordinary controls,
  but keyboard-focused controls keep Space, Tab, Escape, and arrows; editing or
  selecting text and modal UI keep every key. Preserve VoiceOver, Fn/Globe,
  Help, and unsupported modifier chords. Its monitor token belongs to the
  AppKit bridge attached to the live session window; do not move it back into
  SwiftUI `@State` with independent `onAppear`/`onDisappear` callbacks.
- One background gray everywhere: `Color.appBackground`. Don't introduce
  other panel shades; use `Divider()` lines to separate regions.
- One accent color everywhere: `Color.louppeAccent`, the brand purple
  #9853A6 (defined in RootView.swift, applied as a global `.tint` and used
  for the app-icon glyph). Green/red stay reserved for yes/no ratings; don't
  use blue or `Color.accentColor` for anything.

## Known gotchas

- Toolbar Liquid Glass groups follow the owner's arrangement in
  `SessionView.toolbarContent` and use Apple's native fixed `ToolbarSpacer`.
  macOS 26 may show little or no extra separation in the `.navigation`
  placement and wider trailing gaps; the owner explicitly prefers that native
  result to custom equal-width spacing. Do not add custom spacer views.

- **`visibleIndices` must never outlive `items`**: any place that replaces or
  empties `items` must reset/recompute `visibleIndices` in the same turn
  (see `openFolder`) — stale indices crashed the app on re-scan once.
  `visibleItems` bounds-checks as a backstop; keep it that way.
- **Browser rows must observe the store directly**: `BrowserRow` holds its own
  `@ObservedObject` because a macOS `LazyVStack` does not reliably re-resolve
  already-created rows on data changes — as a plain value subtree the rows
  froze their badges and current-photo frame until the view was recreated.
  Keep the row's `.id(item.id)` too (follow-scroll target + state reset when
  Clean Up remaps indices). Details in `Docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.
- **ImageIO embedded thumbnails**: many JPEGs embed a tiny (~160px) preview.
  `ImagePipeline.decodeImage` asks for the fast embedded path first and falls back
  to a full decode when the result is undersized — removing that fallback
  brings back blurry/pixelated previews.
- **Presentation ID is not content identity**: same-folder rescans deliberately
  preserve `PhotoItem.id`, and replacements can preserve filenames and mtimes.
  Media caches and asynchronous thumbnail/full/metadata/histogram/100%-tile/
  video state must follow `PhotoItem.contentRevision`. The v5 disk cache binds
  pixels to scan-time physical identity. Identity-bound production items never
  trust v4/v3 cache bytes; compatibility is limited to items without scanned
  identity and still requires the cache timestamp to postdate the captured
  source timestamp.
- **Grid control drags are not selection drags**: rubber-band hit testing uses
  the existing tile frames and fixed Rating/Play control regions. Do not add a
  `GeometryReader` per control, and do not reject native multi-click Button
  activations—every activation must cycle the rating exactly once.
- **Grid photo selection must be immediate**: `GridImmediateClickSurface`
  commits the first mouse-up synchronously and treats only the second click as
  double-click-to-open. Do not replace it with exclusive single/double SwiftUI
  tap gestures; they delay selection for the system double-click interval.
- **Grid scrolling keeps AppKit's native scroller**:
  `PersistentVerticalScroller` may make the native legacy scroller permanently
  visible and reserve its gutter, but must not replace it with a hand-drawn
  subclass. Resolve an already-mounted scroll view synchronously and coalesce
  the initial deferred lookup so fast lazy-grid updates cannot queue main-actor
  work ahead of the scrolling indicator.
- **100% view identity is persistent**: `GalleryView` must not add
  `.id(item.id)` back to `FullImageView`. The AppKit actual-size viewport stays
  alive across current-item changes so its normalized inspection position can
  be restored. `FullImageView.loadedItemID` prevents stale preview state from
  appearing while that persistent view changes files.
- **100% rendering stays tiled**: one source pixel maps to one backing-store
  pixel. Keep high-resolution work on the two-operation tile queue, retain
  only the visible tile ring, and preserve the 128 MiB decoded-tile ceiling.
  Never replace it with a whole-file 45–100 MP bitmap.
- **Derived session data is explicit**: rating counts update incrementally;
  filter facets and sorted indices rebuild after structural `items` changes.
  Any new code that inserts/removes/replaces photos must call
  `rebuildDerivedData()` before `applyFilter()`.
- **Pairing is a projection, ratings are per physical file**: a paired scan
  keeps the JPEG as a lightweight hidden `PhotoFile`. The first split enriches
  only missing JPEG metadata off-main; later toggles must reuse it without a
  folder rescan. Different RAW/JPEG ratings form a Mixed item (conservatively
  treated as undecided and protected from rating-based Clean Up) until rating
  the pair writes one decision to both files. Schema 2 introduced one entry
  per physical file; schema 4 binds each entry to scan-time file identity,
  schema 5 adds independent stars and color, and schema 6 records the exact
  pre-organization parent path so future hierarchy changes do not nest an old
  Louppe layout. Schema 1 combined entries remain readable.
- **Persistence failures are visible**: a folder sidecar save may fall back to
  the current Application Support snapshot, but failure of both destinations
  must keep the session open and show Retry Saving. Folder/session transitions
  and Quit await a safe result asynchronously. Never restore silent `try?`
  persistence or a main-thread semaphore.
- **Persistence is bound to one folder and one sidecar lineage**: capture
  `SourceFolderIdentity` before scanning, recheck it after scanning/read, carry
  the returned `AccessContext` through every save, and compare the exact raw
  sidecar revision immediately before replacement. Backups are keyed by stable
  directory identity and current snapshots use actor-assigned monotonic
  generations; never fall back to path or `scannedAt` as the current authority.
  One stable-folder advisory lock must span sidecar and backup revision checks,
  replacement/fallback, and lineage update; do not split that transaction.
  Lock acquisition must have a short finite deadline so a stale second process
  can produce a retryable save failure but can never freeze Close or Quit.
  If the exact opened folder path is absent because its volume disconnected,
  a save may advance only its stable-identity-keyed backup under that same lock,
  retaining the last proven sidecar revision and never recreating the missing
  path. Preserve exact `lstat` identities for every ancestor of the opened path
  so a different folder, symlink, non-directory ancestor, permission ambiguity,
  or replacement appearing there fails as `sourceFolderChanged` without
  touching either lineage. A UUID-owned source volume may receive a different
  `st_dev` on remount; allow that only after the complete folder is recaptured
  and its UUID/folder identity matches. If the final folder is absent or
  unreadable, retain strict device checks so a different mounted card cannot be
  classified as the missing original. If a sidecar rename
  may have committed immediately before disconnection, only that exact
  per-access marked revision may be adopted after reconnect; equality with an
  older backup alone must never bypass sidecar CAS. A backup rename followed
  by a sync error must likewise be adopted only when its exact desired bytes
  are observed, so Retry cannot conflict with Louppe's own commit. Quit must
  await an active checkpoint and compare the live monotonic change generation
  with the generation captured by successful sidecar/backup requests; a
  just-opened generation-zero session is a discard-safe baseline, so failure of
  its optional repair does not block Quit. Clean sessions start no new I/O,
  while a backup-only success is already safe to quit and remains manually
  retryable for sidecar repair.
  The obsolete path-keyed backup is read only when both current locations are
  absent. Schema 1–3 filename-only ratings migrate automatically only when
  every saved filename is present. A folder-owned legacy sidecar whose recorded
  path differs may proceed only after **Open Anyway** acknowledges that exact
  sidecar revision; it is rescanned and filename-checked before migration. An
  unowned legacy backup or missing legacy entries require explicit confirmation
  and must not autosave, close-save, or quit-save before it. Missing entries
  may be discarded
  only through **Open Folder and Forget Missing Items**; Close Folder and Quit
  must preserve both legacy copies byte-for-byte.
- **Clean Up has a three-phase boundary**: snapshot on `SessionStore`, file I/O
  in `CleanUpWorker`, apply on `SessionStore`. Do not put `trashItem`/`moveItem`
  loops back on the main actor. While `isCleaningUp`, keep item-index mutations
  blocked, folder switching disabled, and Quit refused so pair rollback and ⌘Z
  remain exact. Export follows the same boundary (`ExportWorker`). The shared
  `activeFileOperation` covers Clean Up, Copy, Move, Source Rename, and Source Organization;
  it blocks folder
  switching, rescan, undo, update checks/installation, and Quit until the
  worker completes or Copy cancels after rolling back its in-progress pair.
  That authority also retains the idle-system-sleep assertion; recovery owns
  it while reconciling. Keep display sleep enabled. Lid-close sleep cannot be
  blocked, so Copy must retain its bounded same-identity remount wait and may
  retry only when the operation temporary path is absent. Never retry over or
  delete an identity-ambiguous partial artifact. An identity-recorded partial
  may be removed through the journal's two reserved paths. Do not add a second
  independent in-flight flag. A recovery pass that is actively touching files
  remains mutually exclusive with new work. An unresolved journal awaiting
  attention blocks only new Copy, Move, Rename, Organize, Trash/Clean Up, and Trash
  undo actions;
  it must never block reviewing, rating, navigation, folder open/close/rescan,
  saving, updates, or Quit.
- `RootView` owns the persistent window's phase-aware content layout through
  `WindowContentLayout`: Welcome/Scanning use `.fullSizeContentView`, while
  Ready removes it so photos cannot scroll behind the liquid-glass toolbar.
  This flag does not choose the window radius. Welcome and Scanning include a
  real unified toolbar (`LaunchToolbarTitle`) so macOS 26 supplies its larger
  native toolbar-window corners; never fake them with a custom window mask.
- Thumbnails letterbox (`fit`) inside square tiles on purpose — fill-mode
  cropping both hid parts of the photo and let portrait images overflow
  their tiles.
- **Multi-selection model**: `selectedIndices` empty = "just the current
  photo" (`effectiveSelection` handles both cases). `SelectionState.itemIDs`
  is the stable authority; `selectedIndices` is its published
  current-generation UI projection. Structural changes must clear both through
  `setSelectionIndices`, or explicitly snapshot/remap stable IDs as same-folder
  rescan does. `applyFilter` removes hidden IDs from both. The Grid-view rubber
  band hit-tests tile frames collected via a `PreferenceKey`, so only
  *rendered* (on-screen) lazy-grid tiles can be caught by the rectangle —
  fine in practice, but don't "fix" it by de-lazifying the grid.
- If the app ever launches with no window visible, suspect corrupted window
  restoration state: `defaults delete com.alexandermarkin.louppe` and
  `rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.alexandermarkin.louppe.savedState`.
- Release verification must validate the loose and archived app independently
  and compare their complete `Contents/` trees; checking only the executable
  and Info.plist can miss a stale or altered embedded framework/resource.

## Repo conventions

- GitHub: `alexander-markin-meow/louppe-media-culler` (public). Commit/push only when the
  owner asks; he reviews PRs via the GitHub UI "Merge" button or asks here.
- **Use `main` only.** Do not create or retain local or remote feature branches
  unless the owner explicitly asks for one. Commit directly to `main` only when
  asked; after any exceptional branch is merged, delete it both locally and on
  GitHub.
- `dist/` and `.build/` are gitignored build products; `AppIcon/` holds the
  source glyph and the built `.icns` (both tracked).
